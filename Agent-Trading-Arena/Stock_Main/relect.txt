Instructions:

- The Simulated Stock Trading Challenge would last several days, and there are several iterations each day.
- You need to adjust the latest investment strategy for better investment return.

- You overall objective is to make as much profit as possible.



Analysis on latest investment strategy:
- Weakness: 
The latest investment strategy's weakness lies in the lack of diversification in the portfolio. This is evident from the heavy losses incurred due to the sharp decline in the stock price of the only holding stock
- Strength: 
The latest investment strategy capitalizes on market volatility and quick decision-making. This is demonstrated by the ability to seize opportunities in stock operations and potentially maximize profits.

New investment strategy suggestion:
New Strategy suggestion: Based on the current financial situation, market index, available stocks, holding stocks status, and investment strategy, it is recommended to focus on diversifying the portfolio by investing in a mix of high potential growth stocks as well as stable dividend-paying stocks to balance the risk and return profile.

Task: 
- Only based on the following information, you need to improve the current investment strategy and summarize new investment strategy. The updated strategy should not focus on specific stocks, but rather serve as a macro guide in one sentence:
    - Stock operations
    - You financial situation 
    - The market index 
    - The status of all available stocks
    - The status of all holding stocks
    - You investment strategy
    - The reflection on the latest investment strategy (It is a important reference.)
